# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes from The Odin Project curriculum in the HTML
Foundations section.

This is the first project from The Odin Project curriculum, and it
consists of putting into practice all of the basic HTML elements that
have been covered so far, such as anchor, image, heading, paragraph,
and list elements, among others. It will also help for putting into
practice the basic Git workflow that will be needed when working on
future assignments and projects that are part of the curriculum.
