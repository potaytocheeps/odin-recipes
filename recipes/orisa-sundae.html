    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A sundae dish made to look like the head of the character Orisa
      from the Overwatch video game.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pint chocolate ice cream</li>
      <li>1 banana, peeled and cut in half</li>
      <li>1 kiwi fruit, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 round wafer cookie</li>
      <li>1 dark chocolate square for eyes, cut into slices</li>
      <li>Caramel sauce</li>
      <li>1 maraschino cherry</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by filling your serving dish with two to three scoops of chocolate
        ice cream, depending on the size of dish. Then gently place the two
        pieces of banana on opposite sides of the ice cream in the dish, and
        add a big scoop of ice cream over the top to hold them down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a couple of kiwi slices around the back of the "head," along with
        the wafer cookie. Insert two pieces of chocolate for Orisa's eyes, and
        then drizzle with caramel sauce and top with a cherry!
