  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    These sweet lengths of fried dough are true delights, with a crunchy
    sweet exterior and a soft, doughty interior. The <em>cajeta</em> is unlike
    any other caramel, boasting rich, earthy flavors. It takes time to make
    but is absolutely worth the effort.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Churros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>&#189; cup sugar, plus 1&#189; tablespoons more</li>
    <li>1&#189; teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>&#189; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cajeta</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 quart goat milk</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>&#189; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>&#189; teaspoon baking soda</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>To make the Churros:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine the &#189; cup sugar with the ground cinnamon in a shallow
      bowl and set aside for coating the cooked churros.
    </li>
    <li>
      Line a plate with paper towels and set near the stove. Pour the
      vegetable oil into a medium sauce pan so it is at least 2 inches
      deep. Begin heating the oil on medium heat to about 375&#176;F.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan over medium heat, combine the
      water, remaining sugar, salt, 2 tablespoons of vefetable oil, and
      cook until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is just about
      to boil. Remove from heat and stir in the flour, mixing until smooth.
      Transfer the warm dough into a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whn the frying oil is hot, hold the piping bag over the pot and squeeze
      out a length of the churro mix to about 4 inches long, and then snip it
      off with scissors so it falls into the hot oil. Do this with several
      churros at a time, frying for just a couple of minutes until they're golden
      brown on all sides. Remove the cooked churros to the plate lined with paper
      towerls to drain, and then roll them in the cinnamon sugar.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>To make the Cajeta:</h3>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>
      Combine the goat milk and sugar in a tall saucepot over medium-high heat.
      Add the cinnamon stick, salt, and vanilla extract, and bring to a boil
      while stirring regularly, which should take around 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from heat and add the baking soda, which will cause the mixture
      to rise and froth, but just keep stirring until it calms back down.
      Return to medium heat and cook for around 1 hour, stirring occasionally,
      until the whole mixture has thickened and turned a nice dark golden brown
      color.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the cinnamon stick and continue to cook for another 20 to 40 minutes
      or so, stirring frequently to keep the bottom from burning. When the sauce
      is thick enough for your liking&mdash;we suggest it be thick enough to coat
      the back of a spoon&mdash;remove from heat and pour into a bowl for dipping.
      The caramel can also be covered and chilled to thicken it a little further.
