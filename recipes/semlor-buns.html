  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    These delicious sweets feature an interesting texture between soft
    fluffy buns, slightly chewy sweet almond paste, and light-as-air
    whipped cream. In Sweden, they are sometimes served in a bowl of
    warm milk.
  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Bun</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup warm whole milk</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 eggs, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cardamom</li>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons water</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Filling and Topping</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>&frac12; cup almond paste</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup whipped cream</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar for dusting [optional]</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine the milk, butter, sugar, and yeast in a medium-size mixing
      bowl. Mix in the salt, 1 egg, and cardamom.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the flour a single cup at a time, stopping when you have a
      fairly wet dough but one that is not sticky.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn out the dough on a lightly floured surface and begin to knead,
      adding a little extra flour as needed. When you have a smooth dough
      that bounces back when poked, place in a clean bowl in a warm place.
      Let rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a baking sheet with a parchment
      paper. Divide the risen dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each of these
      into a ball and place on the baking sheet, leaving ample space between
      them. Beat the second egg with a little of the water, brush the buns
      with the glaze, and let the buns rise for another 30 minutes, until
      smooth and puffy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for around 20 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the baking
      sheet and allow to cool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the buns are cool, use a sharp knife to cut a little cap out of
      the top of each bun, removing the top and some of the bread beneath to
      make space. Divide the almond paste equally between all 12 buns, and
      then add the whpped cream with either a spoon in a dollop or pipe it
      on top of each bun. Replace the little cap of bun on top of the cream,
      use a sifter or fine strainer to dust the semlor buns with powdered
      sugar if using, and serve immediately.
